Im planning to add support for logging into file's, custom grouping, better error handling. I am also planning to make a website and use it for docs, since i don't want to use [JSDoc](jsdoc.app).
But that will take a long time since i am not making it as i go, im planning to start making it after im done with the library (and that will probably take some time since i have a job in real life).
